### Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
As part of my Work Integrated Learning experience, I developed a Discord-like application called **Find My Party**. The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world communication platform where users could connect, communicate, and interact through a client-server system. The project was designed to reflect industry-style software development by requiring structured design, problem-solving, and independent implementation.

**Task:**  
My task was to design and implement a functional messaging application using object-oriented programming principles and networking concepts. This included managing client-server communication, ensuring proper handling of connections, structuring the application into logical classes, and maintaining program stability. The project also required careful debugging while preserving existing functionality.

**Action:**  
I designed the **Find My Party** application using a client-server architecture. The server was responsible for managing connections and message flow, while the client handled user interaction and communication with the server. I separated the program into multiple classes to ensure clean structure and maintainability.  
During development, I encountered issues related to connection handling, application termination, and message flow. I addressed these by tracing execution paths, managing input and output streams correctly, and ensuring resources were closed properly. I followed a disciplined approach by only making changes where necessary and testing the application repeatedly after each fix. This mirrored real workplace expectations where changes must be controlled and verified.

**Result:**  
The application functioned successfully as intended. Users could connect, communicate, and exit the application without errors. This project demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and work independently on a software solution. It also strengthened my understanding of how real-world systems are structured and maintained, contributing significantly to my work readiness.

### Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
Throughout the development of the **Find My Party** application, I encountered several challenges related to debugging, program structure, and managing client-server communication. These challenges highlighted gaps between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

**Task:**  
The task was to reflect on the lessons learnt during the project and identify how these experiences contributed to my technical development, problem-solving skills, and readiness for a professional work environment.

**Action:**  
I learned the importance of planning application structure before writing code, especially when working with multiple interacting components. I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented principles such as responsibility separation and encapsulation. Debugging taught me to approach problems methodically rather than making random changes. I also learned the importance of testing after every change and respecting existing functionality, as unplanned modifications can introduce new issues.

**Result:**  
These lessons significantly improved my confidence and maturity as a developing software practitioner. I now approach projects with greater structure, patience, and attention to detail. The experience has prepared me for future Work Integrated Learning opportunities and real workplace environments where accountability, disciplined problem-solving, and continuous learning are essential.
